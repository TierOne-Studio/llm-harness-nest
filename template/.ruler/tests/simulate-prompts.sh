# simulate-prompts.sh — static skill-trigger simulation.
#
# This is NOT an LLM run. It's a static contract test: for each canonical
# (prompt, expected_skills) case, assert that every expected skill's
# description contains enough keywords from the prompt that the LLM's
# description-match heuristic would plausibly load it.
#
# Failure means trigger drift: either the skill description was weakened,
# or the prompt's expected skill list is now stale. Either way, the
# acceptance test catches it before silent skill-skipping ships.
#
# Threshold: every expected skill must contain ≥1 lowercased prompt token
# (length ≥4) in its description. Stop-words filtered. Threshold=1 catches
# description drift (a removed trigger keyword fails the test) without
# false positives on prompts whose obvious keywords are short (bug, git, db).
#
# Usage: bash .claude/tests/simulate-prompts.sh
